To fix the issue, ensure that all units within the `calc()` function are consistent. If you're mixing percentages and pixel values, carefully consider how they interact. In cases where the order of operations might be ambiguous, you should use parentheses to group operations, enforcing the intended precedence. For example, using `width: calc((100% - 20px) / 2)` ensures the subtraction is done before division.
