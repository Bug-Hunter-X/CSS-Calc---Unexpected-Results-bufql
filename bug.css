The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if there are operator precedence issues. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 10px)` works fine, but a calculation such as `width: calc(100% - 10%)` might not produce the expected result. This often happens when you're trying to calculate a value within a layout that's not straightforward or when the values used inside the `calc()` function have different units.
